The Funnening - Weapons Improved


Increased existing lackluster unique weapon abilities to create more exciting weapon categories.
Improved the effect descriptions so you actually know what the enchantments do (before you spend $6,000 to upgrade them!)
The item ability descriptions below are grouped into numbers which help me remember which enchantments are exclusive of eachother
Please discuss any errors, ideas, or opinions in the comments.  Balancing games is hard to do!
More changes to come!

This mod uses text-strings in the range of:
305149951 - 30515XXXX

Special keywords are added via my other mod, the Keywords Everywhere mod. Everything will work normally without it.  If a keyword isn't recognized, only statuses such as "resists Sound keyword attacks" would have no effect.

You can use it at any time.
Put this below my Keywords mod if you have it.
