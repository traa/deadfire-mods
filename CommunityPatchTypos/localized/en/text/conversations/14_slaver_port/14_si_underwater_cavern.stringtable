      <DefaultText>The tunnel's depths are so black, you can't make out your hand in front of your own face so you don't notice the dead end until your knuckles and then palms have slapped against it.

There's nowhere to go except back down the tunnel's length - all several, long feet of it. 

Your movements have rocked the water around you, and just above, you can make out the muted sound of waves lapping at the lip of the tunnel.

There may be a sliver of space for air... or there might be nothing.</DefaultText>
