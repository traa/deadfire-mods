This mod is dedicated to this song:

Requirements
----------------
This mod requires my Keywords Everywhere mod for advanced keyword abilities to function properly:
	Magificent Escape Cape - Dramatic Break - Jump/Teleport keywords
The equipment in this mod will conflict with any other equipment, abilities, or effects of a mod that changes the same equipment or abilities
The conflicts happen individually for each equipment, ability, and effect.

This mod uses text-strings in the range of:
305149951 - 30515XXXX
400000000 - 410000000


Installation
--------------
Unzip/unpack it into it's own folder and add it to your game's Data\Override folder.
You can use it at any time, but once an item is gained, it won't change after you delete the mod.  You would have to give yourself the item again via the command console or buying it again.
Put this below my Keywords mod if you have it.

Modifying this mod:
To change values of the abilities, open it with Notepad++ and change the Values, or delete the files you don't want changes to.
You can see the code easier by formatting it for the JSON format.

Before you uninstall, be sure to unequip any items, sell them, then rest for a few days.  Now you should be able to buy the items back.
