Have you ever thought about why anyone should ever get excited about +5% fire damage?  Have you caught yourself with thoughts of becoming incredibly powerful, amazingly interesting, and entirely too specific?  I'm here to tell you that you don't deserve yourself, and you're not alone.

Interesting items are possible, they're just not made.  Most items are boring.  But the whole is much greater than it's parts.  Instead of relying on that logic, this mod adds awesome parts.  In this mod you can:

- Grow to the size of a giant
- Live a cursed, blood-frenzied life
- Leap into the stratosphere and come back more powerful
- Blinkstrike+stun+crit
- Exponentially remove maximum health of opponents
- Catch enemies into a time warp
- Get negative 100 will and get a negative 20 Constitution debuff

To install this mod, unzip/unpack it into it's own folder and add it to your game's Data\Override folder.

These items are located in Iolfr's Raiments in Neketaka, or if you downloaded the lootable version they'll be spread throughout the game in stashes and chests.  The lootable version requires the expansions as some of the item placement occurs there.

I have tested each item but will be fixing any other bugs and improving the enchantments and icons.  It's unlikely new items will be added in the near future but definitely will be added longer-term.

This mod is dedicated to this song:
Tchaikovsky - Sleeping Beauty - No. 8a. Pas d'action - Rose Adagio


This mod requires my Keywords Everywhere mod for a few keyword-based abilities in items to work properly, such as:
    Boots - Rocquet
    Boots - Aran
    Heavy Shield - Samus
This mod requires the expansions and will not conflict with any other mod and uses text-strings in the range of:
305149951 - 30515XXXX
400000000 - 410000000

If you want to give yourself the items, press the ` key and type:
