# Spear Engaging Thrust - Interval Timing Optimization

## Overview

This document details the performance optimization implemented for the Spear Engaging Thrust momentum tracking system's interval timing configuration.

## Original Configuration

- **Interval Rate**: `Interval_Footstep` (ID: `47b8ed3c-8899-4ab8-aa01-e51a374ab3ba`)
- **Timing**: 0.33 seconds (approximately 3 times per second)
- **Movement Detection**: Only while moving (`OnlyWhileMoving: true`)

## Optimized Configuration

- **Interval Rate**: `Interval_Momentum_Optimized` (ID: `ae4e8429-a1c1-4604-a19f-7b94e846676e`)
- **Timing**: 0.25 seconds (4 times per second)
- **Movement Detection**: Only while moving (`OnlyWhileMoving: true`)

## Optimization Rationale

### Performance Considerations

1. **Responsiveness vs. Performance Balance**:
   - Increased from 3 to 4 checks per second (33% increase in frequency)
   - Still maintains reasonable performance overhead
   - Provides more responsive momentum stack accumulation

2. **Movement Speed Variations**:
   - Faster interval rate better accommodates various movement speeds
   - Characters with high Dexterity or movement speed bonuses benefit from more frequent checks
   - Reduces the chance of missed movement detection during rapid directional changes

3. **Combat Fluidity**:
   - 0.25-second intervals provide smoother momentum building experience
   - Better synchronization with typical combat movement patterns
   - Maintains the "OnlyWhileMoving" constraint to prevent unnecessary processing when stationary

### Technical Benefits

1. **Stack Accumulation Consistency**:
   - More frequent checks reduce variance in stack timing
   - Better alignment with player expectations for momentum building
   - Improved reliability across different movement patterns

2. **Performance Impact Assessment**:
   - Minimal CPU overhead increase (25% more frequent checks)
   - Only active during movement, so no impact when stationary
   - Single status effect per character, so scaling is linear with party size

3. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - No additional memory overhead
   - Same event handling mechanism
   - Reuses existing interval rate infrastructure

## Validation Scenarios

The optimized timing has been designed to handle:

1. **Standard Movement**: Normal walking/running speeds
2. **Enhanced Movement**: Characters with movement speed bonuses
3. **Combat Maneuvering**: Quick directional changes during combat
4. **Engagement Dancing**: Rapid movement in and out of engagement range

## Performance Monitoring

Key metrics to monitor:
- Stack accumulation consistency across different movement speeds
- System responsiveness during intensive combat scenarios
- No performance degradation in large battles with multiple spear users

## Future Considerations

If further optimization is needed:
- Consider dynamic interval adjustment based on movement speed
- Implement movement distance thresholds for stack application
- Add performance profiling hooks for real-time monitoring
