The Funnening - Weapon Modals

No one was prepared for how far your mother was willing to take the bonuses and penalties.  To weapons.  We're talking about weapon modals.

Balances the weapon proficiency modals, and makes all the bonuses to yourself stacking, so the extra penetration can be combined with other effects.  This does not make the effects on enemies, such as -25 Fortitude, stacking.  If you want to change anything see easy instructions at the end.  For some weapons that were only given stacking effects and the positive effects were unchanged, like the mace, this is a downgrade as their negative bonuses will stack but their positive bonuses are only to enemies and were not improved. The dagger, on the otherhand, now gets stacking Deflection because of this.

The selection menu of modals is now more informative, showing actual statistics rather than a vague description.

A very specific detail is that I did not make the Engagement Limit effects stacking, because this was not done anywhere else in the game.

Mod Requirements
---------------------------------
None, really. Weapon proficiencies! I suppose.


Installation
---------------------------------
Unzip/unpack the top folder and move it into your game's Data\Override folder. If you don't have one, create it.

You can install this mod at any time.

Keep this mod BELOW my Keywords Everywhere mod and Bleeding Keywords mod if you have it.

Modifying this mod:
To change values of the abilities, open it with Notepad++ and format it for JSON, then change the Values, or delete the ability files you don't want changes to. The "stacking" files make the ability effects stack and can be deleted separately if you do not want that option.

To remove this mod, just delete it.
