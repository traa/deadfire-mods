      <DefaultText>A foul alchemickal concoction
	  
Dwarven settlers of The Living Lands are adept at extracting use from the great variety of plants in the region, but even they were stymied by the bloom known as Hagpetal. It took an alchemist more daring than the rest to brew the petals into a tea, testing a theory that the chemicals responsible for the foul stench would, when ingested, actually confer health benefits.
	  
The alchemist was wrong, but his legacy lives on in the foul steam given off by the Hagpetal brew, the scent of which his colleagues claimed put them under such stress that their survival instincts were considerably sharpened.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Small, sharp rocks dipped in poison harvested from jungle vines. First observed in Naga warriors and adopted by some desparate barbarians, the rock is fastened to the inside of clothing, next to the skin. Hard hits drive the rock into the flesh, flooding the blood with the poison and causing intense pain, lending savagery and desparation to attacks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is not uncommon for animals to harness essence naturally in the same way as kith spellcasters manage by study, training, and prayer. The beetle to which this shell belonged had clearly intuited a way to channel essence towards protecting itself.  It worked - so well in fact that the creature was killed for its shell by a cannier hunter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pages from the memoirs of the mysterious "F", a Vailian explorer who narrowly escaped death at the hands of enraged Xaurips in the Dyrwood. The journal tells the tale of how "F" was saved by the intercession of a fellow countryman, a paladin, who was cut down by the xaurips as "F" flung down his belongings and ran away. Profoundly affected by the paladin's sacrifice, "F" vowed to never display such foolishness as to throw his life away charging headlong into a pack of wilder, and has since spent his time skulking from place to place, growing increasingly adept at the art of making himself scarce.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though not united under any specific ruler or ethos, the Oarsmen Of Razai were one of the most fearsome paladin orders of their day.  Their ships sailed the Deadfire, audible for miles around thanks to the constant raucous merrymaking on board. They seemed harmless and oblivious until they were boarding slave ships, ruthlessly slaughtering the crews, and enlisting the slaves into their neverending party.
	  
They sought to deny the Wheel, it is said, by living this life so fully that their souls would refuse to move on to the next one. Their insignia was in the shape of an anchor, symbolizing their attempt to tether their souls to this life.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As a warrior does battle with the enemy, so too do sailors do battle against the sea. Physical toughness is essential: to fell your foe or navigate a storm, nothing must be allowed to impede your strength, speed, and resistance to pain. 
	  
Some fighters of the Pr√≠ncipi sen Patrena carve model ships of wood and wear them as badges, or keep them in pockets, when boarding. These personal icons sometimes take on an almost religious significance, the essence of the owner seeping into the wood.</DefaultText>

	<Entry>
      <ID>20686797</ID>
      <DefaultText>When plague struck the ancient city of Arborensis, the people despaired. Grief, rage and terror flooded the streets for a week as the population dwindled. One day a woman was seen walking the city, clad in a white shroud, her face a mask of serenity. Townspeople followed her, claiming that being near her made their minds feel whole again. She walked through the city with her ever-growing train of followers, until the crowd reached the great bone fire in the city's central square, where corpse piles were burning day and night. Without a word, she flung herself upon the fire, burning with a white flame.
	  
Scholars believe the woman to have been sent by the gods, though for what purpose is unknown. Aedyran scholars of Woedica have speculated that for some reason the city had to be destroyed, but the gods in their mercy sent the woman to salve the townsfolk in their final moments. For whatever reason, figures of the Shrouded Saint can sometimes be found among the possessions of someone who needs to steel themselves against their duty.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This little pouch of Durgan cogwheels is a long way from home. The ancient Pargrunen who founded Durgan's Battery were masters of powerful magic, and these apparent coins- run through with barely-perceptible streaks of adra- are no exception. Linking with the mind of one who carries them, they respond to increased stress by creating a shield out of ambient essence, to increase protection.
	  
These devices were worthless against the Eyeless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The rise of more complex machines powered by animancy and electricity has resulted in demand for more efficient lubrication. This heavily-refined oil packs a lot of power into an extremely small package- though sellers caution against spillage, as the substance is very difficult to get out of clothing without a thorough wash, and is also extremely flammable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This unusual pocket watch keeps time by means of regular pulses of current through a crystal of adra contained within.

      <DefaultText>There is more to deception than simply concealing something from view; misdirection sometimes demands a spectacle to lure the eye away from your true intent. In the chaos of a fight, the mere sight of a sword hilt can cause your opponent to mentally fill in the blanks and focus on what they think they see, and not on what you are truly doing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Animancy is a reviled practice in many parts of Eora, so those who dedicate themselves to the art must learn to protect themselves- not just against superstitious kith, but against the myriad dangers of the wilds where they may research in secrecy.
	  
While many are content simply to master a weapon, more crafty practitioners have devised ways to use the strength of their enemy against them. This charged wire, when applied to a weapon and used skillfully, can create a soul link between users, allowing one to leech the abilities of the other.</DefaultText>
